As a technology, BlockChain needs modelization tools to lead projects conception. BlockChain is a transactional technology shared or not, by users, and each part of the project needs to be modeled in a common way to be understood by anybody working around the project \(technical people, managers, customers â€¦\).

**MoBlo** is a **Mo**delization for **Blo**ckChain.
