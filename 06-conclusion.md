# Conclusion

What about Smart contracts? A smart contract is a “software” directly included in the BlockChain. In the point of view of modelization, a smart contract is represented by an address in the Global Architecture and the interactions with the smart contract can be defined with Business Transactions. But the content of the smart contract itself has to be described with a usual algorithm as any software.

This paper proposes here a modelization for the 4 important parts in BlockChain project implementation. This modelization is done to be understood by anybody possibly concerned by the implementation of the project, from sales people to developers. This modelization delimits the context defined by the BlockChain and what needs to be implemented regarding the BlockChain.
